# UniversalPrism

UniversalPrism is a framework for building loosely coupled, maintainable, and testable XAML applications in Windows 10 UWP.

`UniversalPrism` is a fork of `Prism` with footprints of `Template10`, So if your know how to work with `Prism`, You also know how to it with `UniversalPrism` !

After removal of `Prism.UWP` from `PrismLibrary`, I decided to fill this gap with `UniversalPrism` which not only replaces `Prism.UWP` but also adds `region` support to it, which is my favorite feature of `Prism.Wpf`.
