# SimpleMvvm

Once upon a time there was a library called `Prism` which was supposed to do `MVVM` in UWP, now it's gone.


I always wanted to have a Prism with region support in UWP, but the team behind Prism never had the time of doing that.


There was also another popular library called `Template10` which stopped it's path to let Prism do the hard job.

SimpleMvvm is a framework for building loosely coupled, maintainable, and testable XAML applications in Windows 10 UWP.

SimpleMVVM is a fork of Prism and also has footprints of Template10.
